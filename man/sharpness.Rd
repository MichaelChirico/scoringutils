\usage{
sharpness(predictions)
}
\arguments{
\item{predictions}{nxN matrix of predictive samples, n (number of rows) being
the number of data points and N (number of columns) the
number of Monte Carlo samples}
}
\value{
data frame with sharpness for each interval by date
}
\description{
Determines sharpness of a probabilistic forecast
}
\details{
Sharpness is the ability of the model to generate predictions within a
narrow range. It is a data-independent measure, and is purely a feature
of the forecasts themselves.

Shaprness of predictive samples corresponding to one single true value is
measured as the normalised median of the absolute deviation from
the median of the predictive samples. For details, see \link[stats]{mad}
