Utilities and Functions for Scoring Forecasts


## Components

### Probabilistic Forecasts

#### integer-valued forecasts

#### continues forecasts

### Point Forecasts

#### binary forecasts

#### integer-valued forecasts

#### continues forecasts



### Todo

  - [ ] make good documentation. Add formulas to documentation
  - [ ] add option for working with datetime values
  - [ ] decide on nomenclature of variables
  - [ ] include error handling for functions
  - [ ] add examples to function documentation
  
### Things to discuss
  - [ ] Do we want a vignette, or is the manual enough? 
  - [ ] What other functionality do we want to include? Also: what is already there?
  - [ ] Should we / can we wrap functions from other packages? 
  - [ ] How thorough should formal testing be? 
  - [ ] Do we want to implement something for probabilistic non-MCMC predictions?
  - [ ] should we make a formal distinction between absolute and comparative metrics?
  - [ ] do we want to have an error handling function or error handling within all functions?
