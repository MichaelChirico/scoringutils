This package is designed to help with assessing the quality of predictions. 
It provides a collection of proper scoring rules and metrics that can be 
accessed independently or collectively to score predictions automatically. 
It provides some metrics, e.g. for evaluating bias or for 
assessing calibration using 
the probability integral transformation that go beyond the scope of existing
packages like `scoringRules`. Through the function `eval_forecasts` it also 
provides functionality that automatically and very conveniently
scores forecasts using `data.table`. 

For a quick overview, have a look at the [package vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/scoringutils/vignettes/scoringutils.html)

Note: The CRAN package vignette is outdated. After installation you can access the current package vignette. We are currently also working on a more detailed overview. 

Predicitions can be either probabilistic forecasts (generally predictive 
samples generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedures), quantile
forecasts or point forecasts. 
The type of the predictions and the true values can be either continuous, 
integer, or binary. 

## Installation

The stable version is on CRAN, but is outdated now. We do not recommend using it. 
Please install the current development version. 

This can be done using the [`{drat}`](https://epiforecasts.io/drat/):

```r
install.packages("drat")
drat:::add("epiforecasts")
install.packages("scoringutils")
```

Alternatively, install the development version from github using

```r
remotes::install_github("epiforecasts/scoringutils")
```

## Supported scores and metrics

* `pit`
* `bias`
* `sharpness`
* `crps`
* `dss`
* `brier_score`
* `interval_score`

More information on the different metrics and examples can be found in the 
[package vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/scoringutils/vignettes/scoringutils.html).
