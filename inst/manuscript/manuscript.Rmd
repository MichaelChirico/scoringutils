    Forecasts play an important role in a variety of fields. Their role in informing public policy has attracted increased attention from the general public with the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic. Much theoretical work has been done on the development of proper scoring rules and other scoring metrics that can help evaluate these forecasts. Making these theoretical insights available to end users, however, has been less of a focus. In this paper we introduce \pkg{scoringutils}, an \proglang{R} package that facilitates automated forecast evaluation. It gives the user access to a wide range of scoring metrics for various types of forecasts as well as a variety of ways to visualise the evaluation. We give an overview of the evaluation process and the metrics implemented in \pkg{scoringutils} and show an example evaluation of forecasts for COVID-19 cases and deaths submitted to the European Forecast Hub between May und September 2021.

# Introduction

Good forecasts are of great interest to decision makers in various fields like finance \citep{timmermannForecastingMethodsFinance2018, elliottForecastingEconomicsFinance2016}, weather predictions \citep{gneitingWeatherForecastingEnsemble2005, kukkonenReviewOperationalRegionalscale2012} or infectious disease modeling \citep{reichCollaborativeMultiyearMultimodel2019, funkShorttermForecastsInform2020, cramerEvaluationIndividualEnsemble2021, bracherShorttermForecastingCOVID192021, europeancovid-19forecasthubEuropeanCovid19Forecast2021}. An integral part of assessing and improving their usefulness is forecast evaluation. For decades, researchers have developed and refined an arsenal of techniques not only to forecast, but also to evaluate these forecasts (see e.g. \cite{bracherEvaluatingEpidemicForecasts2021}, \cite{funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019}, \cite{gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007}, and \cite{gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007}). Yet even with this rich body of research available, implementing a complete forecast evaluation in \proglang{R} is not trivial. 

Some packages exist that bundle different scoring metrics together, but none offer the user a standalone solution to forecast evaluation. The \pkg{scoringRules} package \citep{scoringRules} offers a very extensive collection of proper scoring rules. Its exclusive focus on proper scoring rules and the fact that all functions are implemented using vectors and matrices instead of data.frames, however, make it more suitable for experienced users or as a building block in larger applications. It also lacks features like pairwise comparisons between forecast models and plotting functionality that are invaluable in the evaluation process. Other packages like \pkg{Metrics} \citep{Metrics} and \pkg{MLmetrics} \citep{MLmetrics} are geared towards machine learning problems and don't implement the set of metrics and scoring rules desired for forecast evaluation. The \pkg{scoringutils} package aims to bring forth a standardised and tested toolkit. It offers convenient automated forecast evaluation in a \code{data.frame} format, but also provides experienced users with a set of reliable lower-level scoring metrics they can build upon in other applications. In addition it implements a wide range of flexible plots that are able to cover most day-to-day use cases. 

The remainder of this section will provide an overview of the fundamental ideas behind forecast evaluation. Section \ref{metrics} will give a detailed theoretical explanation of the evaluation metrics in \pkg{scoringutils} and when to use them. Section \ref{evalutation-example} will demonstrate how to conduct an evaluation in \pkg{scoringutils} using forecasts of COVID-19 submitted to the European Forecast Hub \citep{europeancovid-19forecasthubEuropeanCovid19Forecast2021} as a case study.

## Forecast types and forecast formats

In its most general sense, a forecast is the forecaster’s stated belief about the future \citep{gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007} that can come in many different forms. Quantitative forecasts are either point forecasts or probabilistic in nature and can make statements about continuous, discrete or binary outcome variables. Point forecasts only give one single number for the most likely outcome. Probabilistic forecast, in contrast, by definition provide a full predictive distribution. This makes them much more useful in any applied setting, as we learn about the forecaster's uncertainty and their belief about all aspects of the underlying data-generating distribution. Probabilistic forecasts are the focus of this paper as well as the \pkg{scoringutils} package. 

The predictive distribution of a probabilistic forecast can be represented in different ways with implications for the appropriate evaluation approach. For most forecasting problems, predictive distributions are not readily available in a closed form (and the \pkg{scoringutils} package therefore does not support scoring them directly). Instead, predictive distributions are often represented by a set of quantiles or predictive samples. Predictive samples require a lot of storage space and also come with a loss of precision in the tails of the predictive distribution, where many samples are needed to accurately characterise the distribution. For that reason, often quantiles or central prediction intervals are reported instead. One recent example of this are the COVID-19 Forecast Hubs \citep{cramerCOVID19ForecastHub2020, cramerEvaluationIndividualEnsemble2021, bracherShorttermForecastingCOVID192021, bracherNationalSubnationalShortterm2021, europeancovid-19forecasthubEuropeanCovid19Forecast2021}. For binary or multinomial prediction targets, common in many classification problems, a probabilistic forecasts is represented by the probability that an outcome will come true. Table \ref{tab:forecast-types} summarises the different forecast types and formats.

\end{table}

## The Forecasting paradigm 

Any forecaster should aim to minimise the difference between the (cumulative) predictive distribution $F$ and the unknown true data-generating distribution $G$ \citep{gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007}. For an ideal forecast, we therefore have 

$$ F = G, $$

where $F$ and $G$ are both cumulative distribution functions. As we don't know the true data-generating distribution $G$, we cannot assess the difference between the two distributions directly. \cite{gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007} instead suggest to focus on two central aspects of the predictive distribution: calibration and sharpness (illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:forecast-paradigm}. Calibration refers to the statistical consistency (i.e. absence of systematic deviations) between the predictive distribution and the observations. Sharpness is a feature of the forecast only and describes how concentrated the predictive distribution is, i.e. how precise the forecasts are. The general forecasting paradigm states that we should maximise sharpness of the predictive distribution subject to calibration. A model that made very precise forecasts would at best be useless if the forecasts were wrong most of the time. On the other hand, a model may be well calibrated, but not sharp enough to be useful. Take a weather forecast that would assign 30 percent rain probability for every single day. It may be (marginally) calibrated when looking at the average rainfall over the course of a year, but it doesn't give much guidance on a day to day basis.  \cite{gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007} discuss different forms of calibration in more detail. 


```{r forecast-paradigm, echo = FALSE, fig.cap= "Schematic illustration of sharpness (top row) and calibration (bottom row). Sharpness is a property of the forecast (grey histograms) only, while calibration is the consistency between the forecasts and the true data-generating distribution (in black).", fig.show="hold"}

# Scoring metrics implemented in \pkg{scoringutils} {short-title="Scoring metrics implemented in scoringutils" #metrics}

The \pkg{scoringutils} package implements a variety of metrics. Table \ref{tab:metrics-summary} gives an overview of the metrics implemented in \pkg{scoringutils} and when they are applicable, while table \ref{tab:score-table-detailed} in the Appendix provides mathematical definitions, as well as a more thorough explanation of all the metrics. 

Some of the metrics focus on sharpness or calibration alone, others are so-called proper scoring rules \citep{gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007}, which combine both aspects into a single number. A scoring rule is proper if a perfect forecaster (the predictive distribution equals the data-generating distribution) receives the lowest score on average. This makes sure that a forecaster evaluated by a proper scoring rule is always incentivised to state their best estimate. Looking at calibration and sharpness independently can be helpful to learn about specific model aspects and improve them. Proper scoring rules are especially useful to assess and rank predictive performance of a forecaster.

## Assessing calibration

There are many ways in which a forecast can be miscalibrated, i.e. systematically deviate from the observations. \cite{gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007} discuss different forms of calibration (marginal, probabilistic, and exceedance calibration). In practice, forecasters usually focus on probabilistic calibration. We also discuss metrics measuring bias, as this is an especially common form of miscalibration. 

### Pobabilistic calibration {#probabilistic-calibration}

Probabilistic calibration means that the forecast distributions are consistent with the true data-generating distributions in the sense that on average, $\tau$\% of true observations will be below the corresponding $\tau$-\%-quantiles of the forecast distributions. This also implies that nominal coverage of the central prediction intervals corresponds to empirical coverage. For example, the central 50\% prediction intervals of all forecasts should really contain around 50\% of the observed values, the 90\% central intervals should contain around 90\% of observations etc. 

We can visualise probabilistic calibration in different ways and \pkg{scoringutils} offers three possibilities. *Interval coverage plots* (see Figure \ref{fig:calibration-plots}) show nominal coverage of the central prediction intervals against the percentage of observed values that fell inside the corresponding prediction intervals. Ideally forecasters should lie on the 45° line. A shift to the left means a forecaster is too conservative and issues a predictive distribution that is too wide and covers more of the observed values than needed. A shift to the right means a forecaster is too confident and the forecast distribution is too narrow. Similarly, *quantile coverage plots* (Figure \ref{fig:calibration-plots}) show the quantiles of the predictive distribution against the percentage of observed values below the corresponding predictive quantiles. For quantiles below the median, a line to the right of the 45° degree line (predictive quantiles lower than the quantiles of the data-generating distribution) means a forecaster is too conservative, while for quantiles above the median, a line to the left of the 45° degree line (predictive quantiles higher than the quantiles of the data-generating distribution) implies conservative predictions. 

<!-- gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007 -->
A similar way to visualise the same information is the probability integral transform (PIT) histogram \citep{dawidPresentPositionPotential1984}. The PIT is equal to $F(x_t)$, the predictive distribution evaluated at the observed value (see more details in Table \ref{tab:score-table-detailed}). If forecasts are probabilistically calibrated, then the transformed values will follow a uniform distribution. When plotting a histogram of PIT values, bias usually leads to a triangular shape, a U-shaped histogram corresponds to forecasts that are under-dispersed (too sharp) and a hump-shape appears when forecasts are over-dispersed (too wide). 

It is in principle possible to formally test probabilistic calibration, for example by employing a test on the uniformity of PIT values (e.g. the Anderson-Darling test \citep{andersonAsymptoticTheoryCertain1952}). In practice this is often difficult as forecasts and therefore also PIT values are often correlated. We therefore advise against using formal tests in most applied settings. It is also important to note that uniformity of the PIT histogram (or a 45° degree line in quantile and interval coverage plots) indicates probabilistic calibration, but does not guarantee that forecasts are indeed calibrated in every relevant sense. \cite{gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007, hamillInterpretationRankHistograms2001a} provide examples with different forecasters who are clearly mis-calibrated, but have uniform PIT histograms.

Second row: PIT histograms based on 1000 observations dranwn from the standard normal true data-generating distribution and 1000 samples from different predictive distributions for each simulated observations. Third row: Empirical vs. nominal coverage of the central prediction intervals for simulated observations and predictions.

### Bias
Biased forecasts systematically over- or under-predict the observed values. The bias metric implemented in \pkg{scoringutils} follows \citep{funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019}, with slight adaptations for different forecast formats. It captures how much probability mass of the forecast was above or below the true value (mapped to values between -1 and 1, with 0 being ideal) and therefore represents a general tendency to over- or under-predict in relative terms. A value of -1 implies that the entire probability mass of the predictive distribution was below the observed value (and analogously above it for a value of 1). 

For forecasts in a quantile-based format, there exists a second possibility to assess bias, using the weighted interval score (WIS, a proper scoring rule explained in more detail in section \ref{wis}). The WIS can be decomposed into three components, two of which capture over- and under-prediction. These two error terms are unbound and assess bias on an absolute scale (analogous to the absolute error of a point forecast), rather than a relative scale. 


## Metrics to assess sharpness

Sharpness is the ability to produce narrow forecasts. In contrast to calibration it does not depend on the actual observations and is a quality of the forecast only \citep{gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007}. Sharpness is therefore only useful subject to calibration, as exemplified in Figure \ref{fig:calibration-plots}. We may be willing to trade off a little calibration for a lot more sharpness, but usually not much. 
For sample-based forecasts, \pkg{scoringutils} calculates dispersion (the inverse of sharpness) as the normalised median absolute deviation about the median (MAD), following \cite{funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019} (for details see Table \ref{tab:metrics-summary}). For quantile forecasts, we instead report the dispersion component of the weighted interval score (see details in section \ref{wis} and \ref{tab:score-table-detailed}) which corresponds to a weighted average of the individual interval widths. 


## Proper scoring rules for sample-based forecasts (CRPS, logS and DSS)

For sample-based forecasts, the \pkg{scoringutils} package provides the following proper scoring rules: the (continuous) ranked probability score (CRPS) \citep{epsteinScoringSystemProbability1969, mathesonScoringRulesContinuous1976, gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007}, the log score (logS) \citep{goodRationalDecisions1952}, and the Dawid-Sebastiani-score (DSS) \citep{dawidCoherentDispersionCriteria1999} (formal definitions are given in Table \ref{tab:score-table-detailed}). The corresponding functions are imported from the \pkg{scoringRules} package and exposed to the user through a slightly adapted interface. Other, non-sample-based variants of the CRPS, logS and DSS are available in the \pkg{scoringRules} package. 

When scoring forecasts in a sample-based format, the choice is usually between the logS and the CRPS. The DSS is much less commonly used. It is easier to compute, but apart from that does not have immediate advantages over the former two. DSS, CRPS and logS differ in several important aspects: Ease of estimation and speed of convergence, treatment of over- and underconfidence, sensitivity to distance \cite{winklerScoringRulesEvaluation1996}, sensitivity to outlier predictions, and sensitivity to the order of magnitude of the forecast quantity. 

### Estimation details and speed of convergence

All three scores are in principle applicable to continuous as well as discrete forecasts. However, the fact that scores in practice need to be estimated based on predictive samples (rather than a closed-form predictive distribution) introduces additional complications. For the CRPS and the DSS, approximate scores can directly be computed based on the empirical distribution function, i.e. based on predictive samples directly. For the log score (which equals the negative log density of the predictive distribution evaluated at the observed value), a density estimation is required first. The \pkg{scoringRules} implementation of the log score used within \pkg{scoringutils} performs a kernel density estimation that may in particular be inappropriate for discrete values (see also Table \ref{tab:score-table-detailed}). The logS is therefore not computed for discrete predictions in \pkg{scoringutils}. The sample-based version of the log score also tends to converge more slowly to the exact score than the CRPS or the DSS, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:score-convergence} (adapted from \citep{jordanEvaluatingProbabilisticForecasts2019}). 

```{r score-convergence, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Top: Convergence of different scores. Scores were computed based on samples of differing size (from 10 to 100,000). This was repeated 500 times for each sample size. The black line is the mean score across the 500 repetitions, shaded areas represent 50\\% and 90\\% intervals, and the dashed line represents the true calculated score.  Bottom left: Change in score when the uncertainty of the predictive distribution is changed. The true distribution is N(0,5) with the true standard deviation marked with a dashed line, while the standard deviation of the predictive distribution is varied along the x-axis. Log score and DSS clearly punish overconfidence much more severely than underconfidence. Bottom right: Score achieved for a standard normal predictive distribution (illustrated in grey) and different true observed values. Log score and DSS punish instances more harshly where the observed value is far away from the predictive distribution.", fig.show="hold"}
include_graphics("plots/sample-convergence.png")
include_graphics("plots/score-deviation-sd-mu.png")
```

### Overconfidence, underconfidence and outliers. 

All proper scoring rules award the best score to the forecaster who reports a predictive distribution equal to the data-generating distribution. However, they differ in how they punish over- or underconfident forecasts. The log score and the DSS punish overconfidence much more severely than underconfidence, while the CRPS does not distinguish between over- and underconfidence and punishes both rather mildly. This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:score-convergence}. Similarly, the CRPS is rather lenient with regards to outlier predictions compared to the log score and the DSS (see Figure \ref{fig:score-convergence}). The CRPS, which can be thought of as a generalisation of the absolute error to a predictive distribution, scales linearly with the distance between forecast distribution and true value. The log score, however, as the log of the predictive density evaluated at the observed value, can quickly go to infinity if the probability assigned to the observed outcome is close to zero. Whether or not harsh punishment of overconfidence and bad predictions is desirable or not depends of course on the setting. If, for example, we wanted to forecast hospital bed capacity, it may be prudent to score forecasts using a log score, because we would likely rather be too cautious rather than too confident. 


### Sensitivity to distance - local vs\. global scores

The CRPS (and to a lesser degree the DSS, which relies on the first two moments of a distribution) is a so-called global scoring rule, which means that the score is sensitive to the distance of the entire predictive distribution from the observed value. The log score, on the other hand, is local and not sensitive to the distance between the observed value and the predictive distribution. The resulting score does not depend on the overall distance between the observed value and the distribution, but only on the probability density assigned to the actual outcome. Figure \ref{fig:score-locality} illustrates the case of two hypothetical forecasters predicting the number of goals in a football match. Both assign the same probability to the outcome that was later observed, but forecaster B gives significant probability to outcomes far away from the observed outcome. The crps as a global scoring rule takes the entire predictive distribution into account and will assign a worse score to forecaster B. The log score is only determined by the probability assigned to the observed outcome and therefore both forecasters receive the same score. Sensitivity to distance (taking the entire predictive distribution into account) may be an advantage in most settings that involve decision making. Forecaster A's prediction that assigns high probability to results far away from the observed value is arguably less useful than B's forecast that assigns higher probability to values closer to it (the probability assigned to the actual outcome being equal for both forecasts). The log score is only implicitly sensitive to distance if we assume that values close to the observed value are actually more likely to occur. The logS may, however, be more appropriate for inferential purposes (see \citep{winklerScoringRulesEvaluation1996}) and is commonly used in Bayesian statistics \citep{gelmanUnderstandingPredictiveInformation2014}. 

```{r score-locality, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Probabilities assigned by to hypothetical forecasters, A and B, to the possible number of goals in a football match. The true number later observed, 2, is marked with a dashed line. Both forecasters assign a probability of 0.35 to the observed outcome, 2. Forecaster A's prediction is centred around the observed value, while Forecaster B assigns significant probability to outcomes far away from the observed value. Judged by a local score like the Log Score, both forecasters receive the same score. A global score like the CRPS punishes forecaster B more severely."}

include_graphics("plots/score-locality.png")
```

### Sensitivity to the order of magnitude of the forecast quantity
As the CRPS is a generalisation of the absolute value, overall scores usually depend on the order of magnitude of the quantity we try to forecast (as the variance of the data-generating distribution usually increases with the mean). This makes it harder to compare forecasts for very different targets, or assess average performance if the quantity of interest varies substantially over time. Average scores tend to be dominated by forecasts for targets with high absolute numbers. This may be desirable,if we care most about forecasts in situations where numbers are high, but usually it is not. The log score is often slightly more robust against this effect, depending on the exact relationship between mean and variance of the data-generating distribution. Another way to address this issue by using pairwise comparisons will be introduced later.

## Proper scoring rule for quantile-based forecasts (WIS) {#wis}
For forecasts in an interval or quantile format, \pkg{scoringutils} offers the weighted interval score (WIS) \citep{bracherEvaluatingEpidemicForecasts2021}. The WIS has very similar properties to the CRPS and can be thought of as a quantile-based approximation. For an increasing number of equally-spaced prediction intervals the WIS converges to the CRPS. One additional benefit of the WIS is that it can easily be decomposed into three additive components: an uncertainty penalty (called dispersion or sharpness penalty) for the width of a prediction interval and penalties for over- and under-prediction (if a value falls outside of a prediction interval). This can be very helpful in diagnosing model problems. It may even be useful to estimate quantiles from predictive samples and use the WIS in addition to the CRPS to make use of this decomposition for the purpose of model diagnostics (with the caveat that estimating quantiles from samples may be biased if the number of samples is small). 
<!-- Think about this again -->

## Proper scoring rules for binary outcomes (BS and logS)

Binary forecasts can be scored using the Brier score (BS) or the log score. The Brier score \citep{brierVERIFICATIONFORECASTSEXPRESSED1950} corresponds to the squared difference between the given probability and the outcome (either 0 or 1) and equals the ranked probability score for the case of only two possible outcomes. The log score corresponds to the log of the probability assigned to the observed outcome. Just as with continuous forecasts, the log score punishes overconfidence much more harshly than underconfidence. The Brier score, on the other hand, does not distinguish between over- and underconfidence \citep{macheteContrastingProbabilisticScoring2012} and is therefore more forgiving of outlier predictions. 

## Pairwise comparisons

In order to compare performance of different models fairly, we can compute relative skill scores based on pairwise comparisons \citep{cramerEvaluationIndividualEnsemble2021}. Models enter a 'pairwise tournament', where all possible pairs of models are compared based on the overlapping set of available forecasts common to both models (omitting comparisons where there is no overlapping set of forecasts). For every pair, the ratio of the mean scores of both models is computed. The relative skill score of a model is then the geometric mean of all mean score ratios which involve that model. This gives us an indicator of performance relative to all other models. The orientation depends on the score used. For the proper scoring rules described above, smaller is better and a relative skill score smaller than 1 indicates that a model is performing better than the average model. We can also compute a scaled relative skill score using a baseline model. In that case those mean score rations which include the baseline are excluded when taking the geometric mean to obtain relative skill scores for individual models (which therefore differ slightly from relative scores without a baseline). All individual relative skill scores are then scaled by (i.e. divided by) the relative score of the baseline model.

It is in principle possible to compute p-values to determine whether two models perform significantly differently. \pkg{scoringutils} allows to compute these using either the Wilcoxon rank sum test (also known as Mann-Whitney-U test) \citep{mannTestWhetherOne1947} or a permutation test. In practice, this is slightly complicated by the fact that both tests assume independent observations. In reality, however, forecasts by a model may be correlated across time or another dimension (e.g. if a forecaster has a bad day, they will likely perform badly across different targets for a given forecast date). P-values may therefore be too liberal in suggesting significant differences where there aren't any. One way to mitigate this is to aggregate observations over a category where one suspects correlation (fore example averaging across all forecasts made on a given date) before making pairwise comparisons. A test that is performed on aggregate scores will likely be more conservative.

The \pkg{scoringutils} package offers comprehensive functionality to conduct a forecast evaluation and allows users to check inputs, score forecasts and visualise results. Most functions operate on a `data.frame`-based format, but the package also provides a set of reliable lower-level scoring metrics operating on vectors/matrices, which experienced users can use in their own evaluation pipelines. Some helper functions for data-handling, as well as example data sets and tables with additional information about available scoring metrics are also included in the package. Internally, operations are handled using \pkg{data.table} to allow for fast and efficient computation. 

## Example data

The example data included in the package and used in this paper consists of one to three week ahead forecasts made between May and September 2021 for COVID-19 cases and deaths from four different forecasting models. It represents a small subset of short-term predictions for COVID-19 cases and deaths submitted to the European Forecast Hub \citep{europeancovid-19forecasthubEuropeanCovid19Forecast2021}. The European Forecast Hub each week collates, aggregates and evaluates one to four week ahead predictions of different COVID-19 related targets submitted by different research groups. Forecasts are submitted in a quantile-based format with a set of 22 quantiles plus the median ($0.01, 0.025, 0.05, ..., 0.5, ... 0.95, 0.975, 0.99$). The full official hub evaluations, which also use \pkg{scoringutils}, can be seen at https://covid19forecasthub.eu/. 

In the following, we will use the \fct{glimpse} function from the package \pkg{tibble} to display outputs more concisely. After loading the \pkg{scoringutils} package we can directly inspect the example data: 

```{r}
library(scoringutils)
library(tibble) 

example_quantile |>
  na.omit() |>
  glimpse()
```


## Expected input formats and data checking

Depending on the format of the forecast, a `data.frame` (or similar) with the following columns is required for most functions. Table \ref{tab:column-requirements} gives an overview of the required columns for functions that operate on `data.frame`s. 

```{r, column-requirements, echo=FALSE}
library(data.table)
requirements <- 
  data.table(
    "Format" = c("quantile-based", "sample-based", "binary", "pairwise-comparisons"), 
    `Required columns` = c("'true_value', 'prediction', 'quantile'", 
                           "'true_value', 'prediction', 'sample'", 
                           "'true_value', 'prediction'", 
                           "additionally a column 'model'"), 
    "Example data" = c("example_quantile", "example_integer, \n  example_continuous", "example_binary", "~")
  )

requirements |>
  kbl(format = "latex", 
      booktabs = TRUE,
      linesep = c('\\addlinespace'),
      caption = "Overview of the columns required for different input formats.") |>
  kableExtra::column_spec(3, width = "3.7cm") |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", 
                                              "repeat_header, scale_down")) 

```

Additional columns may be present to indicate a grouping of forecasts. A combination of different columns should uniquely define the unit of a single forecast, meaning that a single forecast is defined by the combination of values in the other columns. For example, a single forecast could be uniquely defined by a model name, a location, a forecast date and a forecast horizon. 

The function \fct{check\_forecasts} allows to check whether input data conforms to the function requirements and returns a list with entries that provide information on what \pkg{scoringutils} infers from the data. 

```{r,tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=I(70)), echo=TRUE}
check_forecasts(example_quantile)
```

The values stored in the list elements \code{target_type} and \code{prediction_type} refer to type of the forecast and the target variable. \code{forecast_unit} contains a vector of the columns which \pkg{scoringutils} thinks denote the unit of a single forecast. This means that in this instance a single forecast (with a set of 23 quantiles) can uniquely be identified by the values in the columns "location", "target\_end\_date", "target\_type", "location\_name", "forecast\_date", "model", "horizon". In this example, having "location" as well as "location\_name" included does not make a difference, as they contain duplicated information. In general, however, it is strongly advised to remove all unnecessary columns that do not help identify a single forecast. \code{unique_values} gives an overview of the number of unique values per column across the entire data set, providing a first hint as to whether the forecast set is complete. \code{warnings} shows potential warnings about the data. In this example, \pkg{scoringutils} warns that there are observed values present for which there is no corresponding forecast. These warnings can often be ignored, but may provide important information. If there are errors that cannot be ignored, a list entry \code{errors} will appear. 

## Visualising forecast data

It is helpful to start the evaluation process by examining forecast availability, as missing forecasts can impact the evaluation if missingness correlates with performance. The function \fct{avail_forecasts} returns information about the number of available forecasts, given a level of summary that can be specified through the \code{by} argument. For example, to see how many forecasts there are per model and target_type, we can run

```{r avail-forecasts, echo=TRUE, fig.width = 10, eval = TRUE, fig.cap="Overview of the number of available forecasts."}
avail_forecasts(data = example_integer, 
                by = c("model", "target_type"))
```

and visualise results using the function \fct{plot\_avail\_forecasts}. The plot resulting from running the following code is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:avail-forecasts-plot}. 

```{r avail-forecasts-plot, echo=TRUE, fig.pos = "!h", fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4, eval = TRUE, fig.cap="Overview of the number of available forecasts."}
library(ggplot2)

avail_forecasts(data = example_integer, 
                by = c("model", "target_type", "forecast_date")) |>
  plot_avail_forecasts(x = "forecast_date", 
                       show_numbers = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~ target_type) + 
  labs(y = "Model", x = "Forecast date") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

<!-- THIS NEEDS TO BE REWORKED DEPENDING ON WHAT WE DO WITH THE FUNCTION -->

The forecasts and observed values themselves can be visualised using the \fct{plot\_predictions} function. It offers the user an optional ad hoc way to filter both forecasts and observed values. Forecasts and observed values can be passed in separately (and are merged internally) or as a single data.frame. Conditions to filter on need to be provided as a list of strings, where each of the strings represents an expression that can be evaluated to filter the data. To display, for example, short-term forecasts for COVID-19 cases and deaths made by the EuroCOVIDhub-ensemble model on June 28 2021 as well as 5 weeks of prior data, we can call the following. The resulting plot is shown in Figure \ref{fig:forecast-visualisation}. 

```{r forecast-visualisation, fig.pos = "!h", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5, fig.cap = "Short-term forecasts for COVID-19 cases and deaths made by the EuroCOVIDhub-ensemble model on June 28 2021."}
plot_predictions(data = example_quantile,
                 x = "target_end_date",
                 filter_truth = list('target_end_date <= "2021-07-15"',
                                     'target_end_date > "2021-05-22"'),
                 filter_forecasts = list("model == 'EuroCOVIDhub-ensemble'",
                                         'forecast_date == "2021-06-28"')) + 
  facet_wrap(target_type ~ location, ncol = 4, scales = "free_y") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") + 
  labs(x = "Target end date")
```


## Scoring forecasts with \fct{score} {short-title="Scoring forecasts with score()" #scoring}

The function \fct{score} evaluates predictions against observed values and automatically applies the appropriate scoring metrics depending on the input data. We can simply call: 

```{r}
score(example_quantile) |>
  glimpse()
```

The above produces one score for every forecast. However, we usually like to summarise scores to learn about average performance across certain categories. This can be done using the function \fct{summarise\_scores}, which returns one summarised score per category (column name) specified in the argument \code{by}. To return, for example, one score per model and forecast target, we can run the following: 

```{r}
score(example_quantile) |>
  summarise_scores(by = c("model", "target_type")) |>
  glimpse()
```

Summarised scores can then be visualised using the function \fct{scores\_table}. The output of the following is shown in Figure \ref{fig:score-table}: 

```{r score-table, fig.width = 11, fig.cap="Coloured table to visualise the computed scores."}
score(example_quantile) |>
  summarise_scores(by = c("model", "target_type")) |>
  plot_score_table(y = "model") + 
  facet_wrap(~ target_type)
```

While \fct{summarise\_scores} accepts arbitrary summary functions, care has to be taken when using something else than \fct{mean}, because scores may lose propriety when using other summary functions. For example, the median of several individual scores (individually based on a proper scoring rule) is usually not proper. A forecaster judged by the median of several scores may be incentivised to misrepresent their true belief in a way that is not true for the mean score.  

The user must exercise additional caution and should usually avoid aggregating scores across categories which differ much in the magnitude of the quantity to forecast, as forecast errors usually increase with the order of magnitude of the forecast target. In the given example, looking at one score per model (i.e. specifying \code{summarise_by = c("model")}) is problematic, as overall aggregate scores would be dominated by case forecasts, while performance on deaths would have little influence. Similarly, aggregating over different forecast horizons is often ill-advised as the mean will be dominated by further ahead forecast horizons. 

As a proxy for calibration, we are often interested in empirical coverage-levels of certain central prediction intervals, for example the percentage of true values which fell inside all 50% or 90% prediction intervals. For any quantile-based forecast, we can simply add this information using the function \fct{add\_coverage}. The function has a \code{by} argument which accepts a vector of column names defining the level of grouping for which empirical coverage is computed. Note that these column names should be equal to those passed to \code{by} in subsequent calls of \fct{summarise\_forecasts}. 

For sample-based forecasts, calculating coverage requires an extra step, namely estimating quantiles of the predictive distribution from samples. The function \fct{sample\_to\_quantile} takes a \code{data.frame} in a sample-based format and outputs one in a quantile-based format, which can then be passed to \fct{score} and \fct{add\_coverage}: 

```{r}
q <- c(0.01, 0.025, seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.05), 0.975, 0.99)

example_integer |>
  sample_to_quantile(quantiles = q) |>
  score() |>
  add_coverage(ranges = c(50, 90), by = c("model", "target_type")) |>
  summarise_scores(by = c("model", "target_type")) |>
  glimpse()
```

The process is designed to require conscious action by the user, because the estimation of quantiles from predictive samples may be biased if the number of available samples is not sufficiently large. The possibility to a quantile-based format may also be useful for model analytics because of the decomposition of the weighted interval score which is not easily available for the CRPS. 


## Pairwise comparisons

In order to obtain a model ranking, we recommend looking at the relative skill in terms of an appropriate proper scoring rule instead of the raw score. Relative skill scores can be aggregated more easily across different forecast targets as they are less influenced by the order of magnitude of the quantity to forecast than e.g. the WIS or the CRPS. 
<!-- Maybe add some more details and pitfalls, e.g. that models with few locations make these locations relatively more important -->
<!-- It may therefore be sensible to require all models to have submitted forecasts for at least 50\% of all forecast targets in order to enter the pairwise comparisons.  -->

Relative skill scores can either be obtained by specifying \code{relative_skill = TRUE} in the function \fct{summarise\_scores}, or by calling the function \fct{pairiwse\_comparison}. In both cases, pairwise comparisons are computed according to the grouping specified in the argument \code{by}: internally, the \code{data.frame} with all scores gets split into different \code{data.frame}s according to the values specified in \code{by} (excluding the column 'model'). Relative scores are then computed for every individual group separately. In the example below we specify \code{by = c("model", "target_type")}, which means that there is one relative skill score per model, calculated separately for the different forecasting targets. Using the argument \code{baseline}, we can compute relative skill with respect to a baseline model. 

```{r}
score(example_quantile) |>
  pairwise_comparison(by = c("model", "target_type"), 
                      baseline = "EuroCOVIDhub-baseline") |>
  glimpse()
```

When a baseline is provided, pairwise comparisons involving that baseline model are excluded from the computation of relative scores for all non-baseline models. Relative skill scores with a baseline included therefore differ slightly from relative scores without a baseline. Scaled relative skill scores are then computed by scaling (i.e. dividing) all relative scores by the relative score of the baseline model. 
<!-- THINK ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE THIS AGAIN IN THE PACKAGE-->

Pairwise comparisons should usually be made based on unsummarised scores (\fct{pairwise\_comparison} internally summarises over samples and quantiles automatically, but nothing else), as summarising can change the set of overlapping forecasts between two models and distort relative skill scores. When computing relative skill scores using \fct{summarise_scores}, this happens by default. When using \fct{pairwise\_comparison}, the function \fct{summarise\_scores} should usually not be called beforehand. One potential exception to this is when one is interested in the p-values obtained from pairwise comparisons. As forecasts are usually highly correlated (which the calculation of p-values do not account for), it may be sensible to summaries over a few categories to reduce correlation and obtain more conservative p-values. 

Using the function \fct{plot\_pairwise\_comparison} we can visualise the mean score ratios between all models. The output of the following code is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pairwise-plot} (in the SI?). 

```{r pairwise-plot, echo=TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.cap="Ratios of mean scores based on overlapping forecast sets. If a tile is blue, then the model on the y-axis performed better. If it is red, the model on the x-axis performed better in direct comparison. When interpreting the plot one should look at the model on the y-axis, and the model on the x-axis is the one it is compared against. In the example above, the EuroCOVIDhub-ensemble performs best (it only has values smaller than one), while the EuroCOVIDhub-baseline performs worst (and only has values larger than one). For cases, the UMass-MechBayes model is of course excluded as there are no case forecasts available and therefore the set of overlapping forecasts is empty."}
score(example_quantile) |>
  pairwise_comparison(by = c("model", "target_type"), 
                      baseline = "EuroCOVIDhub-baseline") |>
  plot_pairwise_comparison() + 
  facet_wrap(~ target_type)
```


## Model diagnostics

The \pkg{scoringutils} package offers a variety of functions to aid the user in diagnosing issues with models. Some additional analyses and visualisations can be found in section \ref{additional} in the SI. 

For example, to detect systematic patterns it may be useful to visualise a single metric across several dimensions. The following produces a heatmap of bias values across different locations and forecast targets (output shown in Figure \ref{fig:score-heatmap}). 

```{r score-heatmap, fig.pos = "!h", fig.width = 8, fig.cap = "Heatmap of bias values for different models across different locations and forecast targets. Bias values are bound between -1 (under-prediction) and 1 (over-prediction) and are 0 ideally."}
score(example_continuous) |>
  summarise_scores(by = c("model", "location", "target_type")) |>
  plot_heatmap(x = "location", metric = "bias") + 
    facet_wrap(~ target_type) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

For quantile-based forecasts, it is helpful to visualise the decomposition of the weighted interval score into its components: dispersion, over-prediction and under-prediction. This can be achieved using the function \fct{plot\_wis\_components}, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:wis-components} and Figure \ref{fig:wis-components-relative} in the SI. As described in section \ref{scoring} it is possible to convert from a sample-based to a quantile-based forecast format to make use of this decomposition even for sample-based forecasts. 

```{r wis-components, fig.pos = "!h", fig.width = 8, fig.cap = "Decomposition of the weighted interval score (WIS) into dispersion, over-prediction and under-prediction. The WIS components measure over- and under-prediction in absolute, rather than relative terms."}
score(example_quantile) |>
  summarise_scores(by = c("model", "target_type")) |>
  plot_wis(relative_contributions = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~ target_type, 
             scales = "free_x") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Special attention should be given to calibration. The most common way of assessing calibration (more precisely: probabilistic calibration) are PIT histograms, as explained in section \ref{probabilistic-calibration}. Ideally, pit values should be uniformly distributed after the transformation.

We can compute pit values in the following way

```{r}
example_continuous |>
  pit(by = "model") 
```

and create PIT histograms using the function \fct{plot\_pit}. The output of the following is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pit-plots} (see a quantile-based example in Figure \ref{fig:pit-plots-quantile} in the SI): 

```{r pit-plots, fig.pos = "!h", fig.cap="PIT histograms of all models stratified by forecast target. Histograms should ideally be uniform. A u-shape usually indicates overconfidence (forecasts are too narrow), a hump-shaped form indicates underconfidence (forecasts are too uncertain) and a triangle-shape indicates bias.", fig.width = 8, fig.height=4}
example_continuous |>
  pit(by = c("model", "target_type")) |>
  plot_pit() + 
  facet_grid(target_type ~ model)
```

We can also look at interval and quantile coverage plots (explained in more detail in section \ref{probabilistic-calibration}) using the functions \fct{plot\_interval\_coverage} and \fct{plot\_quantile\_coverage}. These plots require that the columns "range" and "quantile", respectively, be present in the scores to plot, and therefore need to be included in the `by` argument when summarising scores. The output of the following is shown in Figure \ref{fig:coverage}.  

```{r coverage, fig.width = 10, fig.pos = "!h", fig.show='hold', fig.cap = "Interval coverage and quantile coverage plots."}
cov_scores <- score(example_quantile) |>
  summarise_scores(by = c("model", "target_type", "range", "quantile"))

plot_interval_coverage(cov_scores) + 
  facet_wrap(~ target_type)

plot_quantile_coverage(cov_scores) + 
  facet_wrap(~ target_type)
```

It may sometimes be interesting to see how different scores correlate with each other. We can examine this using the function \fct{correlation}. When dealing with quantile-based forecasts, it is important to call \fct{summarise\_scorees} before \fct{correlation} in order to summarise over quantiles before computing correlations. The plot resulting from the following code is shown in Figure \ref{fig:correlation-plot}. 

```{r correlation-plot, fig.pos = "!h", fig.width=8, fig.height=4, fig.cap = "Correlation between different scores"}
correlations <- example_quantile |>
  score() |>
  summarise_scores() |>
  correlation() 

correlations |>
  glimpse()

correlations |>
  plot_correlation()
```


## Summary and discussion

Forecast evaluation is invaluable to understanding and improving current forecasts. The \pkg{scoringutils} package aims to facilitate this process and make it easier, even for less experienced users. It provides a fast, flexible and convenient evaluation framework based on `data.frame`s, but also makes a set of scoring functions available to more experienced users to be used in other packages or pipelines. A set of visualisations and plotting functions make help with diagnosing issues with models and allows for thorough comparison between different forecasting approaches. 

The package is still under active development and we warmly welcome contributions to \pkg{scoringutils}. In the future we hope to extend the number of scoring metrics supported. This includes spherical scoring rules, evaluation of multinomial prediction tasks, as well as a broader range of scoring metrics for point forecasts. We also plan to expand the plotting functionality and hope to make templates available for automated scoring reports.
