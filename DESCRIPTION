Description: 
    The scoringutils package provides convenient tools to evaluate forecasts and
    compare predictive performance of different forecasts. It offers a variety
    of metrics and proper scoring rules (Tilmann Gneiting & Adrian E Raftery 
    (2007) <doi:10.1198/016214506000001437>), as well as tools to visualise 
    forecasts and scores. 
    The scoringutils package allows users to evaluate different types of 
    predictions (e.g. binary, discrete, continuous) which may come in different 
    formats (e.g. forecasts represented by predictive samples or by quantiles
    of the predictive distribution). 
    Please cite scoringutils if you use it in your work. Call 
    `citation("scoringutils") for more information.`
    Some proper scoring rules are implemented as a wrapper around functions from 
    the scoringRules package (Jordan, A., Kr√ºger, F., & Lerch, S. (2019)
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v090.i12>). If you use these, please also cite the 
    scoringRules package.
